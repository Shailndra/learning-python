# checking address rather then values

# x = ["5", 21, 1]
# y = ["5", 21, 1]

# # ## Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
# #
# # 1. Create two variables `a` and `b` with numeric values.
# # 2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `a` and `b`.
# # 3. Print the results.
#
# a = 4
# b = 2
# print (a + b)
# print (a - b)
# print (a * b)
# print (a / b)
# print (a // b)




# # ## Task 2: Comparison Operators
# #
# # 1. Compare the values of `a` and `b` using the following comparison operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`.
# # 2. Print the results of each comparison.
#
# a = 2
# b = 2
# print(a < b)
# print(a > b)
# print(a <= b)
# print(a >= b)
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)




# ## Task 3: Logical Operators
#
# 1. Create two boolean variables, `x` and `y`.
# 2. Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to perform various logical operations on `x` and `y`.
# 3. Print the results.

# x = True
# y = False
# print(x and y)
# print(x or y)
# print(not x)


# ## Task 4: Assignment Operators
#
# 1. Create a variable `total` and initialize it to 10.
# 2. Use assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) to update the value of `total`.
# 3. Print the final value of `total`.
#
# total = 10
# # total += 5  #total = total + 5
# # total -= 5  #total = total - 5
# # total *= 5  #total = total * 5
# # total /= 3  #total = total / 5
# total = total + 5
# print(total)


## Task 5: Bitwise Operators (Optional)

# 1. If you are comfortable with bitwise operators, perform some bitwise operations on integer values and print the results. If not, you can skip this task.



# ## Task 6: Identity and Membership Operators
#
# 1. Create a list `my_list` containing a few elements.
# 2. Use identity operators (`is` and `is not`) to check if two variables are the same object.
# 3. Use membership operators (`in` and `not in`) to check if an element is present in `my_list`.
# 4. Print the results.


# x = ["1", 5, 2]
# y = ["1", 5, 2]
# print(x is y)
# print(x is not y)
# print(x in y)
# print(x not in y)
